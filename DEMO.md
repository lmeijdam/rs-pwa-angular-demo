## Demo steps during presentation

There are 2 ways to approach the initial creation of a PWA. one by using the Angular CLI, the other using the Angular Console (either as a plugin for VS code or directly as Windows client).

### Angular CLI

- Download the Angular CLI
````
npm install -g @angular/cli
````

> Note; you can check if you've previously installed the CLI by typing 'ng -v' of 'ng version' in command line.

- Create a new Angular project
````
ng new <name>
````

- Add Angular PWA Schematic (about schematics; https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2)
